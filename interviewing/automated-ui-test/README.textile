h1. Create an Automated test for a single-page Web based application

Example Application is a browser based TODO list:

   http://swannodette.github.io/todomvc/labs/architecture-examples/om-undo/index.html

* Analyze the Application
* Produce a test plan
* Decide on the set of features worth creating automated tests for
* Implement one or more tests using the automation tool of your choice

We would prefer if you used an open or free testing tool so that we can execute the test.

There is no time-limit, please feel free to use on-line resources (documenting what you've used is a plus).

You may submit your test either as a ZIP archive containing any documents and assets you've created, or you may clone this git repository and send us the URL to your repository (or a pull request).

Suggestions for test automation tools:
